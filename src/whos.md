# Who's Cusma?

Hi! I'm Cosimo (aka _cusma_).

I'm a free spirit Pirate 🏴‍☠️🦜, with roots in [Puglia](https://www.instagram.com/weareinpuglia/)
🇮🇹🐙 and the heart in [Pernambuco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco) 🇧🇷🏝.

As an Electrical Engineer, I'm trying to figure out how to leave the cradle with
a handful of Watts ⚡️and Bits 👾. I'm passionate about science, philosophy, music
and art.

I believe that the fact that mathematics, as conceived by human logic, is compatible
with the laws of physics and able to describe the external reality with unbelievable
precision, is a surprising not-trivial evidence that should not be taken for granted.

Discovering law of physics or writing software are just ways to express this powerful
gift we humans have in creating deep relations with the nature to expand the consciousness
of our collective mind.

While engineering new _technologies_, we should always mind not to separate the
[_"techne"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne) from the [_"logos"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos),
since the consequences could be unpleasant.

I try to leave as free human being following the sun ☀️ between Italy 🌍🇮🇹🍝 and
Brazil 🌎🇧🇷🥭, sharing public repositories with coding examples (mostly in Python)
and learning contents (in English, Italian and Portuguese) about what I've learned
so far spending my time studying things that excite me the most.
